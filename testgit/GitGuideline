1. Fork project from Shahrul/testgit
2. Get Git's web URL from forked project: it will be from yourGitId/testgit
3. Run command "git clone https://github.com/yourGitId/testgit.git"
4. "git remote -v"   to view the configured remote Repository
5. "git remote add upstream https://github.com/Shahrul/testgit.git"    this is to connect upstream to the Forked Repository
    5.1 "git remote -v"   now should show additional entry for upstream
6. Always create new branch when making changes
    6.1  use command "git checkout -b newbranchname"
7. When changes is complete
    7.1  Add all modified code for staging "git add ."
    7.2  Commit the changes placed in staging "git commit -m "message for commit" "
8. Once all changes that were commited (there can be multiple commit) are tested, prepare to push the change into github
    8.1  Switch to Master branch "git checkout master"
    8.2  Pull latest Master from upstream "git pull upstream master"
    8.3  Return to newbranchname "git checkout newbranchname"
    8.4  Merge the lates Master from to the new branch "git merge master"
    8.5  Resolve any conflict from the merge, repeat Step 7.
    8.6  "git push origin newbranchname"
9. The changes pushed to the Forked Repository will also notify the upstream Git Repository
    9.1  Create a pull request to pull changes from newbranchname to master 
    9.2  Pull request will be review and approved
    9.3  Merge the changes into master, then delete the branch 

Its is advisable to perform step 8.1 to 8.5 daily before start working, to keep the code base updated and discover potential conflict earlier
Changes should NOT be push into master, always push to branch, and merge into master after review and approval
